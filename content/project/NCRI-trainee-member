I have been appointed as a trainee member of the [National Cancer Research Institute Head and Neck Cancer group](http://csg.ncri.org.uk/ncri_groups/ncri-head-neck-group/). Through my secondment to the group, I will have the chance to gain greater insight into the processes behind high quality cancer research. I anticipate that this will feed back to my own current research, but will also enable me to develop and mentor future academic trainees with an interest in head and neck cancer.
