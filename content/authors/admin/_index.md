Jim Higginson is a higher surgical trainee in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, currently undertaking a PhD at Imperial College London. His project will assess the use of phenomic signatures to evaluate oncological margins during transoral robotic surgery for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. 

He also has research interests in head and neck osteosarcoma, reconstruction of head and neck defects, and the interplay between metabolomics and transcriptomics in head and neck cancer.
