 abstract = {A journal club is a group of individuals who meet on regular basis to discuss publications in the clinical literature. They can take various forms, and promote a number of skills relevant to evidence-based care of patients. The widespread adoption of social media has allowed the development of a philosophy known as 'Free, Open-Access Meducation', or FOAM. One aspect of FOAM is the development of online journal clubs. An online journal club, held on the social networking site Twitter, has recently been developed by the authors for the promotion of critical appraisal and research interest amongst Oral and Maxillofacial trainees and clinicians.},
