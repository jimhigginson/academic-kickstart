  abstract = {Objective: This review aims to provide a structured classification of the underlying steering mechanisms in steerable catheters and to assess their future challenges. Methods: Existing, patented, and experimental designs of steerable catheters are classified with respect to their steerability. Subsequently, the classification is used as a tool for defining future requirements and challenges for steerable cardiac catheters. Results: The results of the classification provide two categories of steering at a fundamental level: 1) Force generation in the tip and 2) force transmission to the tip. The former group consists of force generating steering mechanisms as a result of 1) electric, 2) thermal, and 3) magnetic actuation. The latter group comprises force transmitting steering mechanisms as the result of 4) hydraulic chamber actuation or 5) mechanic cable actuation. Each category can be further subdivided into multiple subcategories. Future requirements and challenges are found for steering and positioning capabilities, cardiac applications and safety, and miniaturization potential. Conclusion: A structured classification is presented which identifies the different steering mechanisms in steerable catheters. The classification proves to be a useful tool in determining future requirements and challenges, being invaluable for future application-driven design. Significance: Using the applied classification as a tool for future design will not only provide insight into previously applied steering technology, it will identify new and unexplored options too. Additionally, insight into the requirements and challenges for catheter steering toward and inside the heart, will allow more dedicated systems, allowing intervention- and patient-specific instrument manipulation.},

  abstract = {Introduction Cancellation of scheduled surgery is undesirable, in the same time, emergency admissions should be managed efficiently to deliver optimal patient care. The aim of this service evaluation was to analyse the impact of cancelling elective patients on the Elective maxillofacial theatres to accommodate pending trauma patients. Audit standards: 1. Trauma cases should be done ASAP within 24 hours. 2. Rebooking time for elective cases should be done within 28 days Methods The theatre lists over 6 months was analysed: 1. How many patients were cancelled and what procedure they required 2. Rebooking time for elective cases. 3. Costs of cancelling the patients verses the addition of trauma patients 4. Time delay for emergency cases Results The number of total elective patients cancelled over 6 months on theatre list was 34. From this, 38\% of patients had their surgery after 28 days. The number of trauma cases added was 19 in this period. It was found that patients admitted on Friday had the longest wait of 5 days. The average tariff balance paid to do the trauma cases over the elective cases was \textsterling 2860. Conclusions There was a significant delay in providing the trauma surgery when the patient was admitted over the weekend. There was a notable disruption to the elective list with the number of patients that had to be cancelled and rebooked. Suggestions for improvement: 1. Improve the CEPOD theatre access, especially over the weekend, dedicated theatre slots in CEPOD and dedicated trauma slot(s) on elective lists.},

  abstract = {A tumor is not simply a group of cancer cells, but rather a heterogeneous collection of infiltrating and resident host cells, secreted factors and extracellular matrix. Tumor cells stimulate significant molecular, cellular and physical changes within their host tissues to support tumor growth and progression. An emerging tumor microenvironment is a complex and continuously evolving entity. The composition of the tumor microenvironment varies between tumor types, but hallmark features include immune cells, stromal cells, blood vessels, and extracellular matrix. It is believed that the "tumor microenvironment is not just a silent bystander, but rather an active promoter of cancer progression" (Truffi et al., 2020). Early in tumor growth, a dynamic and reciprocal relationship develops between cancer cells and components of the tumor microenvironment that supports cancer cell survival, local invasion and metastatic dissemination. To overcome a hypoxic and acidic microenvironment, the tumor microenvironment coordinates a program that promotes angiogenesis to restore oxygen and nutrient supply and remove metabolic waste. Tumors become infiltrated with diverse adaptive and innate immune cells that can perform both pro- and anti- tumorigenic functions (Figure 1). An expanding literature on the tumor microenvironment has identified new targets within it for therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract = {Rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) is an emerging technique that allows near-real-time characterization of human tissue in vivo by analysis of the aerosol ("smoke") released during electrosurgical dissection. The coupling of REIMS technology with electrosurgery for tissue diagnostics is known as the intelligent knife (iKnife). This study aimed to validate the technique by applying it to the analysis of fresh human tissue samples ex vivo and to demonstrate the translation to real-time use in vivo in a surgical environment. A variety of tissue samples from 302 patients were analyzed in the laboratory, resulting in 1624 cancerous and 1309 noncancerous database entries. The technology was then transferred to the operating theater, where the device was coupled to existing electrosurgical equipment to collect data during a total of 81 resections. Mass spectrometric data were analyzed using multivariate statistical methods, including principal components analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and a spectral identification algorithm using a similar approach was implemented. The REIMS approach differentiated accurately between distinct histological and histopathological tissue types, with malignant tissues yielding chemical characteristics specific to their histopathological subtypes. Tissue identification via intraoperative REIMS matched the postoperative histological diagnosis in 100\% (all 81) of the cases studied. The mass spectra reflected lipidomic profiles that varied between distinct histological tumor types and also between primary and metastatic tumors. Thus, in addition to real-time diagnostic information, the spectra provided additional information on divergent tumor biochemistry that may have mechanistic importance in cancer.},

However, factors that regulate metastatic tumor dormancy remain poorly understood. Here we review the potential contribution of interactions between tumor cells and the microenvironment in metastatic sites, in regulating tumor dormancy vs. metastatic growth. We focus particularly on the potential role of the extracellular matrix in regulating maintenance and release from dormancy. Tumor cells that fail to properly adhere to the extracellular matrix may enter a state of dormancy. The molecular and physical composition of the extracellular matrix can be affected by tumor cells themselves, as well as multiple stromal cell types. The roles of integrins, fibronectin, and collagen are discussed, as are factors that can change the extracellular matrix. A better understanding of the molecular details of the crosstalk between tumor cells and the extracellular matrix in secondary sites, and how these regulate the dormant state, may lead to improved therapeutic strategies to induce or maintain disseminated tumor cells in a dormant state, or alternatively to successfully eradicate dormant cells.},

  abstract = {Background: Recurrence of oral squamous cell carcinoma (rOSCC) after primary treatment is associated with poor survival outcomes. Salvage treatment with further surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy has high morbidity, making patient selection crucial. However, in the recurrence setting, reliable stratification data are scarce. Decision-making in this context is consequently complex. We investigated factors influencing overall survival after rOSCC. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of patients with rOSCC (n = 83) at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, UK between 2006 and 2016. Associations with overall survival were analysed using univariate and multivariate analyses to identify important clinical prognostic indicators. Results: Overall survival at 1 year was 32.5\% and at 5 years was 18.1\% after a median follow-up of 7.4 months. Multivariate analysis identified four independent predictors of overall survival following rOSCC: size of primary tumour (HR 2.077; 95\% CI 1.034-4.172), extent of recurrent disease (HR 3.286; 95\% CI 1.545-6.991), history of moderate alcohol consumption (HR 0.351; 95\% CI 0.162-0.763), and close or positive margins at primary resection (HR 1.955; 95\% CI 1.063-3.595). Conclusions: We identified four key factors that help prognostication and risk stratification of rOSCC. Given the high morbidity associated with salvage treatment, we recommend that the multidisciplinary team (MDT) and the patient weigh these factors carefully when considering further treatment. Further investigation of the biology underlying these oncophenotypes may contribute to better patient stratification.},

Traditional approaches to mass spectrometry are detailed, alongside new developments in the field, namely ambient ionisation mass spectrometry and imaging mass spectrometry, which we believe will prove to be important to future work in this field. We further discuss considerations for experimental workflows, data analysis options and propose a methodology for the establishment of causal relationships between functional host-microbiome interactions with regards to health and disease in the human gastrointestinal tract.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Dysplastic changes at the surgical margin of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) could be encountered frequently. However, the impact of a dysplastic surgical margin on patients with OSCC remains unclear. Materials and methods: Retrospectively, we reviewed patients with OSCC who were diagnosed and treated at the National Taiwan University Hospital between January 2010 and December 2015. Patients were divided into four groups: clear ({$\geq$}5 mm), close ({$<$} 5 mm), positive, and dysplastic margins. Results: Of 1642 patients, 596 had clear margin, 169 had positive margin, 707 had close margin, and 170 had dysplastic margin. The mean age at diagnosis was 55 {$\pm$} 11 years (range, 16-97 years). Dysplastic margins were frequently present in patients with primary T1/T2 OSCC (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, p = 0.009), tumor without perineural invasion (OR = 1.48, p = 0.04), and tumor thickness {$\leq$}10 mm (OR = 1.94, p = 0.001). In patients with clear, close, positive, and dysplastic margins, the 5-year disease-free survival rates were 63.1\%, 51\%, 37.2\%, and 54.7\%, respectively; overall survival (OS) rates were 71.1\%, 61.9\%, 49\%, and 72\%, respectively. Disease-free and overall survival were not significantly different in patients with dysplastic and clear margins (p = 0.37 and p = 0.38, respectively). Adjuvant radiotherapy had no significant benefit for patients with dysplastic margins. Finally, a multivariate analysis showed that the presence of a dysplastic margin was not an independent risk factor for disease-free (p = 0.43) and overall survival (p = 0.71). Conclusions: The survival rates of the patients with OSCC who had dysplastic margin were significantly better than those with positive margin.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Medical records for all patients undergoing TORS for treatment of primary oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma from May 1, 2010, to March 31, 2014, at a tertiary care academic cancer center were examined from June through September 2014. Thirty-four patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy after TORS were included in the study. INTERVENTION Primary surgical resection via TORS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The University of Washington Quality of Life, version 4, questionnaire was completed by patients preoperatively and at 1-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month intervals after TORS. Demographic, clinicopathologic, and follow-up data were collected. RESULTS Mean follow-up time was 14 months (May 1, 2010, to April 30, 2014). Most patients had T1 (20 [59\%]) or T2 (13 [38\%]) and N0 (13 [38\%]) or N1 (16 [47\%]) disease. Statistically significant improvement in QOL outcomes was noted in the following postoperative domains: chewing from 1 month (median, 50 [IQR, 50-100]) to 12 months (100 [IQR, 100-100]; P = .048), swallowing from 1 month (70 [IQR, 30-85]) to 6 months (100 [IQR, 70-100]; P = .047) and 1 to 24 months (100 [IQR, 70-100]; P = .048), pain from 1 month (38 [IQR, 25-75]) to 6 months (88 [IQR, 75-100]; P = .006) and 1 to 12 months after surgery (100 [IQR, 75-100]; P = .01), and activity from 1 month (63 [IQR, 50-88]) to 24 months (100 [IQR, 75-100]; P = .03). Two participants (6\%) died during the follow-up period: 1 because of disease and 1 because of a myocardial infarction. Two patients (6\%) required temporary gastrostomy tube placement, but none required tracheostomy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Appropriately selected patients who undergo TORS alone for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma experience acceptable short- and long-term QOL outcomes.},

The aim of this study was to establish if there is a correlation between the radiological nodal staging and the final histological nodal stage. Methods: This was a prospective study of 50 head and neck oncology patients undergoing surgery in Worcester Royal Hospital over an eight month period. Only patients who had intra-oral squamous cell carcinomas were included in this study. Exclusion criteria were patients with dysplasia, melanomas, salivary duct carcinomas, unknown primaries, skin metastases or nodal mass'. Radiological nodal stage was determined by the same consultant head and neck radiologist to reduce bias. Histological nodal stage was established by reviewing histology reports post neck dissection. Correlation between both findings was evaluated. Results: Radiologically predicted node size corresponded to the actual histological node size in 76\% of cases (38/50). Radiology overestimated the node size in 4\% (2/50) of cases and underestimated the node size in 20\% (10/50) of cases. Conclusion: The reliability of radiology was fairly accurate in predicting nodal size. 76\% of patients with involved neck nodes were staged accurately.},

  abstract = {The high metabolic demand of cancer cells leads to an accumulation of H+ ions in the tumour microenvironment. The disorganized tumour vasculature prevents an efficient wash-out of H+ ions released into the extracellular medium but also favours the development of tumour hypoxic regions associated with a shift towards glycolytic metabolism. Under hypoxia, the final balance of glycolysis, including breakdown of generated ATP, is the production of lactate and a stoichiometric amount of H+ ions. Another major source of H+ ions results from hydration of CO2 produced in the more oxidative tumour areas. All of these events occur at high rates in tumours to fulfil bioenergetic and biosynthetic needs. This Review summarizes the current understanding of how H+-generating metabolic processes segregate within tumours according to the distance from blood vessels and inversely how ambient acidosis influences tumour metabolism, reducing glycolysis while promoting mitochondrial activity. The Review also presents novel insights supporting the participation of acidosis in cancer progression via stimulation of autophagy and immunosuppression. Finally, recent advances in the different therapeutic modalities aiming to either block pH-regulatory systems or exploit acidosis will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Objective. This research was initiated to explore the experiences and important elements of swallow therapy in patients after surgery for treatment of head and neck cancer (HNC). Study Design. One-to-one, face-to-face interviews were conducted with patients with HNC 7 to 14 days after oral reconstructive surgery (free, pedicled, or bony flap). Analysis was conducted by using interpretive phenomenology. Results. Analysis of interviews from 15 patients identified 2 overarching themes: ``I never dreamt'' and ``They look at you, and they speak to you.'' There was no way for patients to be adequately prepared for the enormity of the surgery and its consequences; however, the way health care professionals interacted and communicated with the person, rather than the altered and disfigured self, was healing and therapeutic. Conclusions. There is a need for novel ways to prepare patients for HNC surgery and to support them in recovery, including ways to connect and help patients feel human again.

  abstract = {During traditional surgery, the surgeons' hands are in direct contact with organs, and surgeons rely on the sense of touch to perform surgery. In teleoperated robotic systems, all physical connections between the surgeon and both the robot and patient, are absent. The surgeon must estimate the force exerted on organs, based only on visual deformation of tissues he is pulling, pushing, gripping, or suturing. It is hard to imagine how to operate with no haptic sensations, and it is surprising that commercially available robots didn't include until now any Haptic Feedback, despite reports about tissue injury, and inability to perform complex manipulation. The sense of touch must be created by stimuli sensed by the surgeon. Haptic sensors are required to collect and send haptic information, and display them on the operator's side, creating telepresence, known as transparency. Multiple ways have been developed to improve transparency through force feedback and tactile feedback. However, this interferes with the stability of the closed-loop controlling interactions between master, robot and remote environment. Cutaneous feedback is more stable and less transparent; force feedback is more transparent and less stable. Thus, multimodal platforms of haptic feedback would try to find the best trade-off between both modalities.},

  abstract = {While cancer cell proliferation depends on access to extracellular nutrients, inadequate tumour perfusion means that glucose, amino acids and lipids are often in short supply. To overcome this obstacle to growth, cancer cells utilize multiple scavenging strategies, obtaining macromolecules from the microenvironment and breaking them down in the lysosome to produce substrates for ATP generation and anabolism. Recent studies have revealed four scavenging pathways that support cancer cell proliferation in low-n utrient environments: scavenging of extracellular matrix proteins via integrins, receptor-m ediated albumin uptake and catabolism, macropinocytic consumption of multiple components of the tumour microenvironment and the engulfment and degradation of entire live cells via entosis. New evidence suggests that blocking these pathways alone or in combination could provide substantial benefits to patients with incurable solid tumours. Both US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and several agents in preclinical or clinical development shut down individual or multiple scavenging pathways. These therapies may increase the extent and durability of tumour growth inhibition and/or prevent the development of resistance when used in combination with existing treatments. This Review summarizes the evidence suggesting that scavenging pathways drive tumour growth, highlights recent advances that define the oncogenic signal transduction pathways that regulate scavenging and considers the benefits and detriments of therapeutic strategies targeting scavenging that are currently under development.},

Patients typically present with advanced, incurable disease, so new means of detecting early disease are a research priority. Metabolite quantitation is amenable to point-of-care analysis and can be performed in ASCC surrogates such as breath and saliva. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarise progress of ASCC metabolomic studies, with an emphasis on the critical appraisal of methodological quality and reporting.               Method.               A systematic online literature search was performed to identify studies reporting metabolic biomarkers of ASCC. This review was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Cochrane Library and MOOSE guidelines.               Results.               Thirty studies comprising 2117 patients were included in the review. All publications represented phase-I biomarker discovery studies, and none validated their findings in an independent cohort. There was heterogeneity in study design and methodological and reporting quality. Sensitivities and specificities were higher in oesophageal and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas compared to those in lung squamous cell carcinoma. The metabolic phenotypes of these cancers were similar, as was the kinetics of metabolite groups when comparing blood, tissue, and breath/saliva concentrations. Deregulation of amino acid metabolism was the most frequently reported theme.               Conclusion.               Metabolite analysis has shown promising diagnostic performance, especially for oesophageal and head and neck ASCC subtypes, which are phenotypically similar. However, shortcomings in study design have led to inconsistencies between studies. To support future studies and ultimately clinical adoption, these limitations are discussed.},

While being successfully used for diagnosis by experts, this method has not yet been established in clinical routine, partly due to the lack of standards and criteria for classifying various lesions. Our aim was to determine the diagnostic value and inter-rater reliability of CLE in detecting malignant lesions of the vocal cords. 58 video sequences were extracted from the probe-based CLE (GastroFlex probe with a Cellvizio\textregistered{} laser system) examinations of 3 patients with squamous cell carcinomas and 4 patients with benign alterations of the vocal folds. Two ENT surgeons, who were blinded to the histological result, were asked to identify the sequences representing a carcinoma. We showed an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 91.38-96.55\%, 100\%, 87.8-95.2\%, 77.27-89.47\% and 100\%, respectively, with an inter-rater reliability of k = 0.89 (``almost perfect agreement''). Probe-based CLE is a promising method for diagnosis and assessment of vocal fold lesions in vivo. Our results suggest that, with adequate training, the diagnostic value of this technique can be improved and potentially provide important information during oncological surgery.},

Early reports of TORS in the head and neck are favourable in both primary and recurrent disease. TORS has a role in the assessment of the patient with unknown primary and in the de-intensification of therapy in patients with cancers secondary to human papilloma virus. In this review we discuss the practical set up and technical features of TORS surgery and the application of TORS in primary and recurrent disease, and carcinoma of unknown primary. We outline the current ongoing research into the use of this technique and set out the vision for the future of this surgical modality.},

Survival curves by margin status were generated by Kaplan-Meier methods. Categorical data were evaluated with odds ratios (OR). Results: All-cause mortality was markedly higher in cases with positive margins as compared with those with negative margins (54\% versus 29\%, P = 0.005). This pattern also appeared after adjusting for age and sex (OR = 2.97, 95\% CI: 1.29 \textendash{} 6.84). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that positive surgical margin status is associated with increased mortality. This association also generally persists after adjustment for tumor size, stage, and adjuvant therapy.},

In 47\% of extractions involving lower third molars we are adhering to NICE guidelines. 66\% of patients who received extraction of third molars were given appropriate consent regarding the risk of nerve damage. 28\% of GA cases had the discussion of LA and sedation documented in the patient records. Conclusion: Patients should be provided with complete information in a format that they can understand to enable them to give informed consent. We must adhere to nationally recognised guidelines to ensure that treatment can be justified and is in the patient's best interests. Consent forms and record keeping provide our evidence for the justification for carrying out treatment and the consent process.},

Although 58\% of participants had been practising anaesthesia for over 10 years, only 25\% were aware of this guideline. 3 consultants (6\% of the cohort) were acupuncture practitioners but only 1 participant (2\% of the cohort) practiced acupuncture as per SIGN clinical guideline 117. Conclusion: If our hospital is representative of DGH's in the UK, we thus concluded that there is a general lack of awareness about the possible benefits of acupuncture related to ENT procedures in anaesthetic practice. Combined with lack of training and limited resources, this is preventing a practice which might be beneficial in patients not tolerating pharmacological methods, who are at high risk of developing PONV, or likely to suffer complications related to PONV.},

  abstract = {Introduction and aims: Malignant melanoma accounts for approximately 5\% of all cutaneous cancers. Overall survival is affected by numerous factors, including tumour size, Breslow thickness and histological subtype. The site of origin also affects prognosis, but it is not clear whether prognosis varies with facial subsite. The aim of our study was to identify whether the subsite of origin of facial melanoma affected overall survival. Method: All patients diagnosed with melanoma of the head and neck between 2001\textendash 2018 at Worcestershire Acute Hospitals Trust were included in the study. Data were collected on demographics, histology, facial aesthetic subunit of origin, and survival. Univariate survival analysis (log rank), and multivariable analysis (Cox proportional hazards model) was performed using the R statistical package. Results: 151 patients were included. Median age was 75. Median survival was 6.65 years. The incidence was highest on the cheeks (53), scalp (26), neck (26), forehead (23) and pinna (12). Univariate analysis showed a significant effect on survival of histological subtype, T-stage, Breslow thickness, lymphovascular invasion and ulceration. Facial site of origin did not affect overall survival (p = 0.44). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that only increasing age (p {$<$} 0.001) and Breslow thickness (p {$<$} 0.05) were independently associated with worse prognosis. Conclusion: The defect resulting from excision of facial melanoma presents a significant reconstructive challenge, but resection must be oncologically guided. We evaluated our outcomes to see whether subsite affected survival. Our data do not show any significant difference in survival between subsite of origin of facial melanoma.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The introduction of microvascular free flap reconstruction has improved functional and aesthetic outcomes in head and neck surgery. Success rates are around 95\% in the primary surgery setting. Increasing numbers of patients are undergoing free flap reconstruction after previous surgery and/or chemoradiotherapy, which can compromise the suitability of recipient vessels. In addition, some flaps that may otherwise be suitable may be compromised by inadequate pedicle length. Interpositional vein grafts (IVG) are an accepted technique for providing additional pedicle length, though due to a small evidence base, some concerns remain about their reliability. Methods: All microsurgical cases at our institution (University Hospitals Birmingham) were evaluated for the use of IVGs from 2005-2016. The case notes were examined retrospectively, and data collected on the recipient, flap donor and IVG donor sites, prior surgery, and prior chemoradiotherapy. Results: Of 1325 cases in our database, 13 (1\%) underwent free flap reconstruction with an IVG for both artery and vein. 1 flap failed due to venous congestion and undervent a second free flap with further vein grafting, giving a total of 14 free flaps in 13 patients. A range of different flaps were used. All anastomoses were performed with 9/0 Ethilon. The maxilla was the recipient site in 9 cases. 10 patients had undergone previous surgery and radiotherapy; 7 of these had undergone previous chemotherapy. Conclusions: We present here one of the largest case series of interpositional vein grafts in microvascular reconstruction of the head and neck. Our free flap success rate with IVG was 93\%: comparable with our overall success rate of 95\%. These resutls are in the context of a complex population, the majority of whom had had previous radiotherapy. IVGs are a reliable technique for use in patients where pedicle length or recipient vessels are compromised.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES To estimate rates of acute dysphagia and recovery after TORS and to compare swallowing outcomes by primary treatment modality (TORS or radiotherapy). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This case series study was a secondary analysis of prospective registry data from 257 patients enrolled from March 1, 2015, to February 28, 2018, at a single academic institution who, according to the AJCC Staging Manual, 7th edition TNM classification, had low- to intermediate-risk human papillomavirus\textendash related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma possibly resectable by TORS. EXPOSURE Patients were stratified by primary treatment (75 underwent TORS and 182 received radiotherapy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Modified barium swallow (MBS) studies graded per Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity (DIGEST) and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory\textendash Head and Neck Module (MDASI-HN) questionnaires were administered at standard intervals. Prevalence and severity of dysphagia were estimated per DIGEST before and after TORS and 3 to 6 months after treatment. Moderate-severe dysphagia (DIGEST grade Ն2) was assessed using logistic regression and compared by primary treatment group. The MDASI swallowing symptom severity item scores during and after radiotherapy were compared using generalized estimating equations by treatment status at the start of radiotherapy, after induction, and after TORS. RESULTS A total of 257 patients (mean [SD] age, 59.54 [9.07] years; 222 [86.4\%] male) were included in the study. Dysphagia severity (per DIGEST) was significantly worse after TORS (r = -0.63; 95\% CI, -0.78 to -0.44): 17 patients (22.7\%; 95\% CI, 13.8\%-33.8\%) had moderate-severe (DIGEST grade Ն2) acute post-TORS dysphagia significantly associated with primary tumor volume (odds ratio, 1.43; 95\% CI, 1.11-1.84). DIGEST improved by 3 to 6 months but remained worse than that at baseline; at 3 to 6 months, the number of patients with DIGEST grade 2 or higher dysphagia was 5 (6.7\%; 95\% CI, 2.2\%-14.9\%) after primary TORS and 29 (15.9\%; 95\% CI, 10.9\%-22.1\%) after radiotherapy. At the start of radiotherapy, MDASI swallowing symptom severity item scores were significantly worse in the post-TORS group compared with postinduction (mean [SD] change, 2.6 [1.1]) and treatment-naive (mean [SD] change, 1.7 [0.3]) patients. This result inverted at radiotherapy end, and all groups converged at 3 to 6 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Subacute swallowing outcomes were similar regardless of primary treatment modality among patients with low- to intermediate-risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.},

  abstract = {Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is an advanced optical fluorescence imaging technology that has potential to increase intraoperative precision, extend resection, and tailor surgery for malignant invasive brain tumors because of its subcellular dimension resolution. Despite its promising diagnostic potential, interpreting the gray tone fluore\- scence images can be difficult for untrained users. CLE images can be distorted by motion artifacts, fluorescence signals out of detector dynamic range, or may be obscured by red blood cells, and thus interpreted as nondiagnostic (ND). However, just a single CLE image with a detectable pathognomonic histological tissue signature can suffice for intraoperative diagnosis. Dealing with the abundance of images from CLE is not unlike sifting through a myriad of genes, proteins, or other structural or metabolic markers to find something of commonality or uniqueness in cancer that might indicate a potential treatment scheme or target. In this review, we provide a detailed description of bioinformatical analysis methodology of CLE images that begins to assist the neuro\- surgeon and pathologist to rapidly connect on\-the\-fly intraoperative imaging, pathology, and surgical observation into a conclusionary system within the concept of theranostics. We present an overview and discuss deep learning models for automatic detection of the diagnostic CLE images and discuss various training regimes and ensemble modeling effect on power of deep learning predictive models. Two major approaches reviewed in this paper include the models that can automatically classify CLE images into diagnostic/ ND, glioma/nonglioma, tumor/injury/normal categories, and models that can localize histological features on the CLE images using weakly supervised methods. We also briefly review advances in the deep learning approaches used for CLE image analysis in other organs. Significant advances in speed and precision of automated diagnostic frame selection would augment the diagnostic potential of CLE, improve operative workflow, and integration into brain tumor surgery. Such technology and bioinformatics analytics lend themselves to improved precision, personalization, and theranostics in brain tumor treatment.},

Materials and methods: We prospectively analyzed 113 patients with head and neck cancer who underwent unilateral neck dissection by a robot-assisted postauricular facelift approach (38 patients) or conventional trans-cervical approach (75 patients). Postoperative functional outcomes such as edema, sensory loss, pain, and fibrosis in the neck, and limitations of neck and shoulder motion, and cosmetic satisfaction scored by questionnaire were evaluated serially up to 1 year postoperatively, and compared between the two groups. Results: There were differences at baseline clinicopathologic characteristics including age, T classification and stage between the two groups. The mean score of neck edema was lower in the robotic group than that of the conventional group at 1 day and 3 days postoperatively, and sensory loss was also lower in the robotic group at 1 day, 3 days and 1 week postoperatively (P {$<$} 0.05). The postoperative cosmetic satisfaction were significantly higher in the robotic group than the conventional group at 1 month, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Transient marginal nerve palsy was higher in the robotic group than the conventional group (P = 0.043). Conclusion: Postoperative neck edema and sensory loss were lower in the robotic group in the early postoperative period although its clinical significance is not clear. Cosmetic satisfaction was superior in the robotic group.},

Using the iKnife to sample the aerosol of cauterized specimens, we demonstrate a new mode of real-time diagnosis, coupling metabolic phenotype to mutant PIK3CA genotype. Oncogenic PIK3CA results in an increase in arachidonic acid and a concomitant overproduction of eicosanoids, acting to promote cell proliferation beyond a cell-autonomous manner. Mechanistically, mutant PIK3CA drives a multimodal signaling network involving mTORC2-PKCz-mediated activation of the calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Notably, inhibiting cPLA2 synergizes with fatty acid-free diet to restore immunogenicity and selectively reduce mutant PIK3CA-induced tumorigenicity. Besides highlighting the potential for metabolic phenotyping in stratified medicine, this study reveals an important role for activated PI3K signaling in regulating arachidonic acid metabolism, uncovering a targetable metabolic vulnerability that largely depends on dietary fat restriction.},

  abstract = {Surgical removal with negative margins is the preferred management of oral squamous cell carcinomas. This review summarizes statements by professional organizations and data supporting the specimen-driven approach to margin assessment. Practical aspects of the intraoperative margin assessment, as guided by gross examination, are presented. The most costand time-efficient method of intraoperative margin assessment depends on desired margin clearance and likelihood of other adverse histologic factors, such as extranodal extension, perineural invasion, which are likelier in advanced carcinomas. Intraoperative surgeon-pathologist communication can be improved by reporting to surgical team gross distances to all or selected closest margins, before choosing margins for microscopic frozen examination. Case specific mitigation strategies to minimize the negative impact of tumor-bed driven margin assessment or of suboptimal margin revision are proposed. Based on size, shape, histology, size of carcinoma at the margin, and orientation of the additional tissue, margin revision may be judged as adequate (conversion of a positive margin into a negative one), inadequate (positive margin remains positive), or indeterminate. The significance of anatomic subsite based labeling, radial margin sampling from the main resection specimen, and the relationship between the distance to closest margin and local control are highlighted. The modern definition of safe margin would account for other parameters, such as perineural invasion. An updated approach to resolution of frozen versus permanent sampling issues is outlined. Future studies are needed to design and validate risk models that would help to determine for individual patient what represents a safe margin and how to judge the quality of margin revision.},

Despite this, analysis of surgical margins is fraught with inconsistencies, including the ways in which margins are sampled and interpreted. Fundamentally, even the definition what constitutes a "clear" (or negative) margin may vary between institutions, surgeons, and pathologists. METHODS: The PubMed database was queried for articles relevant to the topic, and experts in the field were consulted regarding key articles for inclusion. Abstracts were reviewed and the full text was accessed for articles of particular interest. RESULTS: Data regarding various approaches to traditional~margin analysis have been published without~consensus.~Several next-generation technologies have emerged in recent years that hold promise. CONCLUSION: An overview and appraisal of traditional margin analysis techniques are provided. Additionally, we explore novel technologies that may assist in more accurate margin assessment, guide the extent of surgical resections intraoperatively, and inform decisions regarding adjuvant treatment postoperatively.},

In this Timeline article, we review the developmental phases of the TME paradigm since its initial description. While illuminating controversies, we discuss the importance of interactions between various microenvironmental components and tumour cells and provide an overview and assessment of therapeutic opportunities and modalities by which the TME can be targeted.},

  abstract = {Introduction/Aims: Orthognathic surgery encompasses a range of procedures designed to improve the alignment of the teeth and jaws. It is a fundamental part of oral and maxillofacial practice, with approximately 3000 orthognathic procedures performed annually in the NHS. The perception exists that orthognathic surgical practice is not supported by a strong evidence base. To test this assumption, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of the literature investigating orthognathic surgery to analyse the quality of the most influential studies. Methods: A systematic search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed via Web of Science. Titles and abstracts were reviewed to identify all studies related to orthognathic surgery. Studies evaluating implants, hydroxyapatite, animal models, distraction osteogenesis, and orthognathics in cleft patients were excluded. Results were ranked by number of citations: the 100 most cited papers were included for analysis. Bibliometric data were collected for each study. Results: Of the 100 most cited papers none constituted level I evidence. There were 3 studies at level II, 48 at level III, 51 at level IV and none at level V. 59\% of paper evaluated clinical outcomes and complications, followed by 18\% evaluating treatment planning and 14\% evaluating patient related outcome measures (PROMs). There were twice as many papers on Mandibular surgery (21) than on Maxillary surgery (10). Conclusions: Our analysis confirms our hypothesis that there is a weak evidence base in orthognathic surgery. We suggest the need for studies with higher levels of evidence to strengthen our current clinical practice.},

Engineers and physical scientists have made contributions to all aspects of cancer biology, from quantitative understanding of tumour growth and progression to improved detection and treatment of cancer. Many early efforts focused on experimental and computational modelling of drug distribution, cell cycle kinetics and tumour growth dynamics. In the past decade, we have witnessed exponential growth at the interface of engineering, physics and oncology that has been fuelled by advances in fields including materials science, microfabrication, nanomedicine, microfluidics, imaging, and catalysed by new programmes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), including the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), Physical Sciences in Oncology, and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Alliance for Nanotechnology. Here, we review the advances made at the interface of engineering and physical sciences and oncology in four important areas: the physical microenvironment of the tumour and technological advances in drug delivery; cellular and molecular imaging; and microfluidics and microfabrication. We discussthe research advances, opportunities and challenges for integrating engineering and physical sciences with oncology to develop new methods to study, detect and treat cancer, and we also describe the future outlook for these emerging areas.},

A limitation of wasted theatre productivity is required to alleviate pressures on waiting lists. Productivity, which is a measure of treatment time as a proportion of available/allocated time, takes into consideration variations in operator performance, early (non-funded) theatre starts, and over-run, and its analysis enables the determination of theatre downtime and lost theatre capacity. We monitored productivity over a 12-week period and performed downtime analysis as reported in the NHS Improvement national audit (NHSI). Results showed a marked but predictable variation in productivity connected to turnaround and session list scheduling. Productivity and booking efficiency correlated uniformly (Pearson's r = 0.82). Theatre downtime was analysed with respect to three components defined in the NHSI national audit: late starts, early finish, and turnaround. We found that lost theatre time was predominantly due to early finishes; late starts were infrequent. Transport time correlated unfavourably with productivity (Pearson's r = -0.29, p = 0.037) and over-run (r = 0.44), and prolonged transport times were shorter when surgery was performed in a dedicated day surgery unit. Calculating the mean transport times for lists with high compared with low productivity helped us set a benchmark for patient transport times for future audit.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare the long-term outcomes of transoral robotic surgery with those of nonrobotic surgery for patients with early-stage oropharyngeal cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort comparative effectiveness analysis was performed of patients in the National Cancer Database with clinical T1 and T2 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015, who underwent definitive robotic and nonrobotic surgery. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and propensity score matching were performed in patients with known human papillomavirus status to adjust for patient- and disease-related covariates. Survival after robotic and nonrobotic surgery was also compared in 3 unrelated cancers: prostate, endometrial, and cervical cancer. Statistical analysis was performed from April 10, 2019, to May 21, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overall survival. RESULTS Of 9745 patients (7652 men [78.5\%]; mean [SD] age, 58.8 [9.6] years) who met inclusion criteria, 2694 (27.6\%) underwent transoral robotic surgery. There was a significant increase in the use of robotic surgery from 18.3\% (240 of 1309) to 35.5\% (654 of 1841) of all surgical procedures for T1 and T2 oropharyngeal cancers from 2010 to 2015 (P = .003). Robotic surgery was associated with lower rates of positive surgical margins (12.5\% [218 of 1746] vs 20.3\% [471 of 2325]; P {$<$} .001) and lower use of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (28.6\% [500 of 1746] vs 35.7\% [831 of 2325]; P {$<$} .001). Among 4071 patients with known human papillomavirus status, robotic surgery was associated with improved overall survival compared with nonrobotic surgery in multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95 CI, 0.61-0.90; P = .002). Similar results were seen when analyzing only the subset of facilities offering both robotic and nonrobotic surgery. The 5-year overall survival was 84.8\% vs 80.3\% among patients undergoing robotic vs nonrobotic surgery in propensity score\textendash matched cohorts (P = .001). By contrast, there was no evidence that robotic surgery was associated with improved survival in other cancers, such as prostate cancer (HR, 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.79-1.07; P = .26), endometrial cancer (HR, 0.97; 95\% CI, 0.90-1.04; P = .36), and cervical cancer (HR, 1.27; 95\% CI, 0.96-1.69; P = .10). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study suggests that transoral robotic surgery was associated with improved surgical outcomes and survival compared with nonrobotic surgery in patients with early-stage oropharyngeal cancer. Evaluation in comparative randomized trials is warranted.},

Patients: Fifteen consecutive patients with SCC of the oral cavity, hypopharynx, and larynx were included from the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, HSK Dr Horst Schmidt Kliniken GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany Interventions: Confocal endomicroscopy was performed during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures with a prototype of a rigid laser endoscope in combination with the already available technology of autofluorescence. Main outcome measures: Real-time visualization of cellular and subcellular details during endoscopy. Diagnostic scores were applied to differentiate dysplastic and malignant mucosal changes of SCC of the head and neck from normal squamous cell mucosa using this method. Results were correlated with the well-established gold standard, histologic analysis. Results: Dysplastic and malignant changes of head and neck squamous cell mucosa were endoscopically determined by this unique in vivo application of confocal laser endomicroscopy using a rigid probe. Conclusions: We present preliminary and descriptive data using this novel technology in vivo. Considering the impact of a virtual real-time histologic analysis, this technology points to a very promising development. It may carry potential for quicker intraoperative diagnosis, less need for multiple frozen sections, and more precise resection margins.},

The differentials included osteomyelitis, bony metastases, multiple myeloma or other cystic lesions. The patient underwent incision and drainage of the abscess, alongside biopsies, and intravenous co-a\- moxiclav was given. Microbiology cultures confirmed the presence of Actinomyces israelii and a diagnosis of cervicofacial actinomycosis with mandibular osteomyelitis.

  abstract = {Background: The literature often cites margin status as being free, close or involved by tumor but there is very sparse evidence of the relevance of dysplasia at resection margin. Aims/Objectives: To compare the impact of dysplasia at final resection margin (D-FRM) and other margin statuses on overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS). Methods: This is a retrospective review of 1700 treatment na\"ive oral squamous carcinoma patients who underwent surgery between January 2012 and December 2015. The study arm consisted of patients with dysplasia at final resection margin (D-FRM). Each of these patients were double propensity matched to obtain positive (P-FRM), close (C-FRM) and free final resection margins (F-FRM). Results: There was no hazard discrimination in survival among the D-FRM and C-FRM (vs F-FRM; p0.597, HR-1.207 (0.621\textendash 2.346) and p-0.075, HR-1.594 (0.947\textendash 2.684), respectively). A decreasing survival trend was observed as the grade and number of D-FRM margins increased. Although not significant, the addition of adjuvant therapy for D-FRM showed a trend towards improved survival outcomes compared to C-FRM, especially with chemotherapy. Conclusion and relevance: The presence of D-FRM, irrespective of grade, had a similar impact on survival as C-FRM and underscores the possible need for treatment intensification.},

Results: Of significance are the reports indicating superiority of tumor specimen directed sampling of margins compared to patient directed (tumor bed) sampling for frozen section control of oral cancers. With reference to optimal distance between tumor and the surgical margin, recent reports recommended cutoffs less than 5 mm. Employment of new technologies such as light spectroscopy and molecular analysis of tissues, provide opportunities for a ``real time'' assessment of surgical margins. Conclusions: The commonly practiced method of patient directed margin sampling involving previous studies raises concern over conclusions made regarding the efficacy of frozen section},

We also discuss our dilemmas concerning recent minimally invasive endoscopic microsurgical techniques for the trans-oral laser removal or co-ablation of aero-digestive tract tumours, which result in a minimal surgical margin of oncological clearance. By a process of inductive argument as to the nature of the surgical margin, we consider whether the risks of taking a lesser margin with adjuvant therapy is justified by the attendant gain in reduced surgical morbidity and the possible costs in tumour control.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The anterolateral thigh (ALT) is a versatile perforator flap; they can be raised with or without skin, according to the desired characteristics at the recipient site. They are commonly used for oral, pharyngeal or lateral skull reconstruction. Donor site seroma - post-surgical collection of tissue fluid - is a known complication of ALT flaps, with a published incidence of around 5\%. Drains or compression dressings are often recommended to prevent seroma, without strong evidence. Our unit is a busy cancer centre, but employs the ALT relatively infrequently, partly due to the habitus of many of our patients. We noted that several of our patients developed seromas, requiring aspiration. To evaluate our own practice, we performed a retrospective case-control study with the aim of establishing our seroma rate, and identifying any contributory factors to seroma formation. Methods: The University Hospitals Birmingham Head and Neck Database was searched to identify patients who underwent reconstruction with an ALT flap between 2012 and 2016. Case notes were reviewed retrospectively for factors that were potentially contributory to the formation of seromas. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the significance of categorical data; regression modelling was used to evaluate continuous data. Results: 32 patients underwent ALT reconstruction: 4 (12.5\%) developed donor site seroma. Patients who had a muscle/fascia only flap were more likely to develop a seroma than those who had a fasciocutaneous flap (p=0.016). No other surgical, demographic or medical factors were significant. Conclusion: We demonstrated a significant relationship between ALT flaps raised without skin and seroma formation. We hypothesise that this may reflect the increased tension required for closure where skin is lost: the resultant compressive effect may help to prevent the accumulation of tissue fluid. However, this analysis must be interpreted with caution due to our small numbers.},

Similarly, the incidence of head and neck cancers in the younger female population is increasing and women are often conceiving at later ages. This presents an ethical dilemma of managing pregnant patients with head and neck cancer, balancing optimal treatment for the mother against protecting the fetus from harm. Objectives: The aims of this literature review were to explore the evidence base behind the safety of carrying out urgent dental treatment in pregnant patients. We also explored the evidence for treatment options available to patients diagnosed with oral cancer in pregnancy. Methods: The authors carried out a literature search in October 2018 using Medline. Findings: Barriers to primary care dentists providing urgent dental care to pregnant patients include: inability to manage this anxious patient group; lack of historical evidence on the safety to the fetus; lack of continuing professional development in this area; potential litigation risks; a fear of inducing labor. Conclusion: The treatment options available for the patient diagnosed with oral cancer in pregnancy include: termination of pregnancy; early delivery via cesarean section due to advances in neonatology; postpone treatment until after delivery; or to provide suboptimal treatment during pregnancy. We review the evidence we have available for these treatment options to help support patient autonomy.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The diagnosis of cancer of unknown primary (CUP) in head and neck occurs when the treating clinicians have utilised all available diagnostic tests and failed to identify the origin of the disease. There is no agreed consensus on which diagnostic investigations to use, or the order in which to use them in, although broad recommendations exist. Small tumours arising in the tongue base can be below the limits of resolution of conventional diagnostic techniques. Given the difficulty in targeting the tongue base, current practice involves blind random biopsies, which leads to a variable detection rate. Robotically assisted surgical removal of the tongue base, tongue base mucosectomy (TBM) has been shown to improve diagnostic yield. This study reports the diagnostic hit rate for tongue base primaries using this technique. Design: Retrospective case review. Setting: UK Head and Neck Centres. Participants: Patients presenting as an unknown primary, investigated with clinical examination, PET-CT and palatine tonsillectomy. Main Outcome Measures: The detection of a primary site of head and neck cancer in the otherwise unknown primary tumour. Results: The primary tumour site was identified in the tongue base in 53\% (n=17) of patients. In 15 patients the tumour was in the ipsliateral tongue base (88\%) while in two cases (12\%) the tumour was located in contra lateral tongue base. Conclusions: Trans-oral robotic assisted TBM raises the possibility of identifying over 50\% of tumours that would otherwise be classified as CUP. Identifying these in the contralateral tongue base has implications for treatment planning and outcome.},

A null hypothesis was chosen: there is no difference in microleakage among the tested materials. Materials and Methods: A total of 30 Class II cavities were prepared in freshly extracted molars with the proximal mesial and distal margins located, respectively, 1.5 mm apically and 1.5 mm coronally to the cementum-enamel junction. Restorations were completed using a three-step enamel-dentin adhesive system ``Etch and Rinse,'' margins were relocated using a micro-hybrid, preheated, or flowable composite and restorations were then completed using a conventional composite. All samples were coated with nail varnish with the exception of an area along the margins and apex was sealed using epoxide cement and then thermocycled (30-s dwell time, 5\textdegree C/55\textdegree C, 1000 cycles). A 50\% ammoniac AgNO3 solution was used as tracer according to Tay's protocol. The microleakage analysis was performed using a microtomography system Sky-scan 1072 (SKYSCAN, Kartuizersweg 3B 2550, Konitch, Belgium). Results: The mean microleakage of all the tested materials showed greater leakage in the cementum margins; flowable composite exhibit greater leakage among the groups. Significant differences (P {$<$} 5\%) within groups in both enamel and dentin margins were present. None of the tested materials eliminated marginal microleakage. Preheated composite showed significantly lesser microleakage. Conclusion: Tested materials showed statistical differences in microleakage; thus, the null hypothesis has been rejected. Within the limitations of the present experimental procedure, it can be concluded that flowable resin composite should be avoided at the dentin/cementum margin.},

  abstract = {Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery can benefit from the automation of common, repetitive or welldefined but ergonomically difficult tasks. One such task is the scanning of a pick-up endomicroscopy probe over a complex, undulating tissue surface to enhance the effective field-of-view through video mosaicing. In this paper, the da Vinci\textregistered{} surgical robot, through the dVRK framework, is used for autonomous scanning and 2D mosaicing over a user-defined region of interest. To achieve the level of precision required for high quality mosaic generation, which relies on sufficient overlap between consecutive image frames, visual servoing is performed using a combination of a tracking marker attached to the probe and the endomicroscopy images themselves. The resulting sub-millimetre accuracy of the probe motion allows for the generation of large mosaics with minimal intervention from the surgeon. Images are streamed from the endomicroscope and overlaid live onto the surgeons view, while 2D mosaics are generated in real-time, and fused into a 3D stereo reconstruction of the surgical scene, thus providing intuitive visualisation and fusion of the multi-scale images. The system therefore offers significant potential to enhance surgical procedures, by providing the operator with cellular-scale information over a larger area than could typically be achieved by manual scanning.},
