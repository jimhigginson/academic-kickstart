I have just submitted my stage two application for an NIHR doctoral training fellowship.
The amount of work involved in getting to the point of just being able to *submit* an application is enormous, far greater than I expected when I first contemplated it.
I learnt a great deal along the way, and though I've not been awarded the fellowship, or even had the interview yet, I thought I'd put down a few of my thoughts in the hope that it might help someone else.

Whilst the relevance will, I hope, be universal, I suspect much of what I say will be less revelatory for individuals applying from a specialty or workplace with a positive culture of academia.
My experience, however, has been one very much of having to clear a path for myself, especially at the start.

If this sounds like the position you're in, I hope this is helpful.

I must have read it 20 times by the time I pressed `submit`.
There is a huge amount of information to absorb, and whlist you will probably need help with many parts of it.
