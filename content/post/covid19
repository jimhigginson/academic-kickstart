As many people in the world redirect their time and energy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I have had to follow suit, and my cancer research has stopped.

After a short period of reflection, I have now directed my time and energy into offering a positive contribution. First, I have volunteered my medical knowledge and experience in a COVID-specific intensive care unit in the Midlands. I have found the team dedicated, warm and welcoming, and whilst I did contract the COVID-19 (I assume: I was not tested) I recovered within a week and have returned to work with enthusiasm.

In the downtime afforded to me by these clinical commitments, I am also helping my research group at Imperial College in developing a rapid, point-of-care test for COVID-19 using principles repurposed from the technology I was using for intraoperative cancer detection.

I recoginse that I am fortunate in having a way of being productive and occupied, when I know that many are feeling the strain of isolation from leisure, friends and family.

If you are reading this, I hope that you are staying safe, and staying home.
