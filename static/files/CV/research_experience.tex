\section*{Research Experience}

As demonstrated by my publications, presentations, grants and awards, I am an experienced academic with a wide range of skills.

I am a regular peer reviewer for BMJ Case Reports and the British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery

I was a member of the NCRI head and neck research group, providing feedback to researchers on grant proposals and providing oversight on the nationwide portfolio of head and neck cancer research. I am now on the NCRI early researcher group assisting the restructured head and neck committee on working groups as they arise.
