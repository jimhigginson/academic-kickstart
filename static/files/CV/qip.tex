\years{2019} Following concerns about theatre utilisation, performed a service evaluation identifying the causes of lost theatre capacity. In collaboration with the quality improvement team at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, we identified that late starts were uncommon, but early finishes and prolonged patient transport times were key determinants of lost capacity. These findings were published in August 2020 (See `Publications', page \pageref{publications}, and provided both a benchmark for transport time to allow future audit, and also a clear definition of the terms \textit{efficiency} and \textit{productivity} in the context of theatre capacity.

\years{2019} Worked with Colleagues, Divisional Management and Trust IT to deliver an electronic referrals system (`Norse') to reduce interruptions for junior staff and time spent on the phone for referring clinicians.

\years{2017} Identified that dentally-qualified medical students working at Worcestershire hospitals were struggling to be present for the start of medical school after night shifts. Worked with the clinical director, clinical lead and HR to adjust the shift pattern to 0700--1900, allowing these vital team members to handover and attend their medical school commitments more easily.

\years{2015} Contributed to the East Grinstead Consent Collaborative---Identifying variance in practice when consenting for major head and neck procedures, and recommending changes to standardise practiceacross the UK.
